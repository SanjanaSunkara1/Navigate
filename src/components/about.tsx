            As a high school senior who has navigated the complexities of the American education system, 
            I understand firsthand how overwhelming it can be - especially for students who are new to this country. 
            The U.S. high school system is unique, with its own terminology, requirements, and pathways that 
            can be confusing even for students who have lived here their entire lives.

            I created this app because I believe every student deserves to understand their educational journey 
            and have access to the tools they need to succeed. Whether you're transitioning from middle school 
            or moving to the United States from another country, this guide is here to help you navigate 
            with confidence.
